# VEHICLE MANAGEMENT

The proposed system is a comprehensive web application that employs a range of cutting-edge technologies to streamline and enhance the management of vehicle-related data and services. Built using the Python Flask framework, the backend drives the core functionalities, while the frontend leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including the Chart.js library for data visualization. The system integrates two powerful databases, MySQL and MongoDB, to efficiently store and manage data.

Authentication functionalities, including login, registration, password management, and logout, ensure secure access to the system. The admin module encompasses user query management, statistics generation, user administration, and a comprehensive vehicle database. Additionally, it stores and manages insurance details and traffic violation records, providing a centralized hub for essential vehicular information.

Users benefit from a user-friendly interface, enabling them to input and access their vehicle information, insurance details, and traffic violation records. The system serves as a bridge between vehicle owners and their pertinent data, empowering users with easy access to critical information and facilitating efficient management of their vehicles.

This project harnesses the power of modern technologies to create a unified platform that simplifies the interaction between users and their vehicular data, ultimately contributing to improved organization, accessibility, and decision-making in the realm of vehicle management.
